## LEAP (Lightweight EAP) [~~Vulnerable~~]
- An early Cisco proprietary authentication method made to combat WEP
- To authenticate, the client must supply username and password credentials
- Authentication server and client exchange challenge messages that are encrypted and returned, creating a mutual authentication
---
## EAP-FAST
- EAP Flexible Authentication by Secure Tunneling
- Authentication credentials are protected by passing a protected access credential (PAC) between the AS and the supplicant
- The PAC is a form of shared secret, generated by the AS and used for mutual authentication
- Two separate authentication processes - one between the AS and the supplicant and another between the AS and the end user
#### EAP-FAST Sequence
1. **Phase 0**
    - PAC is generated and installed on the client
2. **Phase 1**
    - Once the supplicant and AS are authenticated, they negotiate a TLS tunnel
3. **Phase 2**
    - End user is authenticated through the TLS tunnel for additional security
---
## PEAP (Protected EAP)
- The AS presents a digital certificate to authenticate itself with the supplicant in the outer authentication. If the supplicant is satisfied with the identity of the AS, the two build a TLS tunnel used for inner client authentication and encryption key exchange
- The digital certificate identifies the owner and is signed by a third party, known as the Certificate Authority (CA) (this CA must be trusted by both parties)
- The supplicant must possess the CA certificate so it can validate the one it receives from the AS
- The certificate is used to pass a public key (in plain view) to decrypt messages from the AS
- Because the client does not have a certificate, it authenticates within the TLS tunnel using one of the following
    1. MSHCAPv2
        - Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol v2
    2. GTC
        - Generic Token Card
        - A hardware device that generates one-time passwords for the user
---
## EAP-TLS [Most Secure]
- Requires a certificate on the AS and on every client
- AS and supplicant exchange certificates and can authenticate each other
- Once the AS and supplicant authenticate, a TLS tunnel is built so that encryption key material can be securely exchanged
- Uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to supply certificates securely/efficiently and revoke them, by setting up a CA or building a trust relationship with a third-party CA that supplies certificates to clients
