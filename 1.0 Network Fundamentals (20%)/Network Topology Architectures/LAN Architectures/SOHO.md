## Small Office/Home Office [SOHO]
- Refers to the designs and implementations that have a small amount of requirements - few switch ports, APs, routers, etc
- With a SOHO, the AP, which is in the router, acts autonomously, instead of using a WLC
- The AP uses Ethernet protocols to convert the differences in header formats between 802.11 and 802.3 frames before forwarding to 802.11/3
- A single router in a SOHO functions like the following
    - An Ethernet switch for wired Ethernet connections
    - A wireless AP to communicate with wireless devices and forward the frames to/from the wired network
    - A router to route packets to/from the LAN and WAN
    - A firewall
