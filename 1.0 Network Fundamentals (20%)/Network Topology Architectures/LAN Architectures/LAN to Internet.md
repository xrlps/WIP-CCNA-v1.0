## Wireless WAN
- Mobile phones use radio waves to communicate to a nearby mobile phone tower, through small radio antennas
- Mobile phone towers include a router, and the providers build their own IP network (like an ISP)
- The customer IP packets pass through the IP router (at the tower), into the mobile providerâ€™s IP network, then out to the internet

## Fiber (Ethernet) Internet Access
- Unlike DSL and Cable internet that use copper wiring, ISPs offer internet access through _fiber Internet_, which uses fiber cabling
- Fiber cables are installed underground, which uses Ethernet protocols over the cabling
