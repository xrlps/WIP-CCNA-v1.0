## Containers
- Software packages that contain an App and all the dependencies needed for it to run
- A container is created for a single app
- Containers run on a container engine (ie. Docker Engine). A container engine runs on the host OS
- Containers are lightweight, including _only_ the application and the dependencies needed to run the app. They do not have their own OS.
- A container orchestrator is a software platform for automating the deployment, management, scaling, etc of containers
    - Kubernetes
    - Docker Swarm
