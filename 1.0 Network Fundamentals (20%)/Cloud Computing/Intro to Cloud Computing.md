## Cloud Computing
- Refers to the approach of how to offer services to customers with the following characteristics (from NIST)
    1. **On-demand self-service**: A consumer can choose when to start/stop using the service without a middle man
    2. **Broad network access:** The service must be available from many types of devices over many types of networks
    3. **Resource pooling:** The provider creates a pool of resources (instead of dedicated servers) and dynamically allocates these resources (from a _cloud services catalog_)
    4. **Rapid elasticity:** The resource pool appears to be unlimited to the consumer (elasticity)
    5. **Measured service:** The provider can measure and report usage

## Cloud Service Types
### IaaS
- Infrastructure as a Service
- A consumer specifies the hardware performance/capacity and receives a VM accordingly
- Once they instantiate/spin-up the VM, they can then install their needed apps
### SaaS
- Software as a Service
- Consumer receives a service with a working software
- The cloud provider may use one, or many, VMs to create and supply the service but this is hidden from the consumer
- The consumer has no choice over the application once they have selected the one they want to use
- iCloud, Google Drive, etc
### PaaS
- Platform as a Service
- A consumer specifies the hardware performance/capacity and receives a VM with pre-installed applications, like an IDE
- Comes pre-installed with applications meant for software development

## Cloud Deployment Methods
### Private Cloud
- A cloud infrastructure is offered for exclusive use to a single organization
- This infrastructure can be owned, managed, and operated by a single organization, a third party, or a combination
- Can be located on or off premises
- Generally used by large enterprises
### Community Cloud
- A cloud infrastructure is offered for exclusive use by a community of consumers that have shared concerns (ex security or compliance considerations)
- This infrastructure can be owned, managed, and operated by one or more organizations from the consumers, a third party, or a combination
- Can be located on or off premises
### Public Cloud
- A cloud infrastructure is offered for open use by the general public
- This infrastructure can be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or a combination of them
- Exists on the premises of the cloud provider
### Hybrid Cloud
- A combination of two or more cloud infrastructures
