## Workgroup Bridge
- Used to provide wireless connectivity to a non-wireless device
- Connects to the client via wired connection, and connects to the AP via wireless
---
## Repeater
- Used to extend wireless coverage beyond a normal APs cell footprint by strengthening and repeating signals
- An additional AP that is configured to repeat/retransmit signals in a new cell area
- Must operate on the same channel that the AP is using
- Can potentially halve the throughput of an AP because the channel will be kept busy twice as long as before. As a solution, repeaters can use two transmitters and receivers to keep the original and repeated signals on two different channels

## Outdoor Bridge
- An AP can be configured to act as a bridge to form a single wireless link from one LAN to another over a long distance
- Uses outdoor bridged links to connect between buildings/cities
- A point-to-multipoint bridged link allows a central site to be bridged to several other sites
