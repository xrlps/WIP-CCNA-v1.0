## 802.11 Amendments
- An access point can be configured with and support multiple 802.11 amendments at once
- A client and an AP can communicate only if they both support and agree to use the same amendment
- APs can operate on both bands simultaneously to support any clients that might be present on each band
- Wireless clients typically associate with an AP on one band at a time, while scanning for potential APs on both bands
- A wireless client can initiate an association with an AP on one band and then switch to the other band if the signal conditions are better there
